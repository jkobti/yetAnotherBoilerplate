## 7. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to enhance user experience, maintain sessions, analyse usage patterns and personalise content.

You can manage your browser or device settings to block or delete cookies, though this may limit your ability to use certain features of the Services.

## 8. Sharing & Disclosure of Personal Data

We will not sell or lease your Personal Data to third-parties for marketing purposes. We may share your Personal Data in the following circumstances:

We require such parties to maintain confidentiality and adhere to data protection standards via Data Processing Agreements.

- To comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests by public authorities or enforcement agencies, or to protect our rights, property, or users.
- If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or business reorganisation, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction — in which case we will require that the recipient continues to honour this Privacy Policy.
- With your explicit consent or where you have directed us to share your information.

## 12. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access.
